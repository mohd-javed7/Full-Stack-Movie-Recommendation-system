⚠️ Model Files Notice

The trained model artifacts (similarity.pkl and vectors.pkl) are not included in this repository
because they are very large and exceed GitHub's file size limits.

This project is notebook-driven.

To reproduce the model:
1. Download the dataset from the link below
2. Open `data_preproccessing.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook cells step by step

The notebook will preprocess the data and generate the required
similarity and vector files locally.
